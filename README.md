Unity_SerialPort
================

This repository presents a script and or prefab developed to allow drag and drop capability for serial communication within the Unity3D game development ecosystem. This in turn allows for the use of  custom gaming controllers and hardware developed on platforms such as Arduino and Netduino within Unity applications.

In addition to the example Unity3D files also included is an Arduino sample which can be used to test the serialports functionality.

For more information on the use and install of the files following download check out my blog: www.dyadica.co.uk
